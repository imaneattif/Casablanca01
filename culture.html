            <p>Casablanca's art and architecture are marked by a distinctive blend of Moroccan traditions and European influences, particularly from the French Protectorate era. The city is renowned for its Art Deco buildings, reflecting the grandeur of the early 20th century. Prominent examples include the Palais de Justice and the main Post Office. The Hassan II Mosque, a modern marvel of Islamic architecture, is another highlight, known for its intricate designs and the world's tallest minaret. The architecture in Casablanca is a mix of Art Deco, Art Nouveau, neo-Moorish, and neo-Moroccan styles, showcasing a unique blend of modernity and tradition. Efforts are underway by groups like Casam√©moire to preserve these historic structures amidst modern development pressures</p>

                Casablanca's culinary scene is a delightful blend of Moroccan traditions 
                and international influences. Its cuisine features the iconic Tajine, a 
                rich stew, and Ksra Bread, a traditional staple. The Harira soup offers 
                a flavorful combination of tomatoes, lentils, and meat. Pastilla, a sweet 
                and savory pastry, and fresh Moroccan salads add variety to the menu. 
                The national drink, Mint tea, complements the meal, especially when paired 
                with oriental sweets like fruit-filled cakes. Casablanca's restaurants 
                range from traditional Moroccan to Mediterranean and French cuisines, 
                with a focus on fresh seafood, reflecting its coastal location.
